The Stock Price Movement Predictor is a Python project designed to analyze and predict the direction of a stock's price movement based on historical data, specifically focusing on price and volume information. 
The goal of this project is to assist investors and traders in making informed decisions by providing insights into potential future price trends.
#ML 
The project utilizes the LightGBM (LGBM) algorithm for prediction. This choice was made due to its efficiency, as XGBoost (XGB) was found to be too slow for the given dataset. The LGBM algorithm is known for its speed and performance in handling large datasets.
Hyperparameter tuning is performed using Hyperopt to optimize the model's performance.
